Data Analysis: Real Estate Investment and Development

I’m beginning a project to identify and predict long-term real estate behavior based on economic, demographic, and psychographic data to define better practices for real estate investment and development.

Over the coming weeks, my updates will likely follow the typical ETL process.

Data Analysis / ETL Process

Extract: Gather the necessary data from sources (e.g., files, databases, APIs).

Transform: Assess, clean, and format the data.

Load: Create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) / database schema and aggregate the transformed data into a database or warehouse for analysis and reporting.

For the analysis and reporting of metrics and trends, I’ll create visualizations and deploy a dashboard using Tableau.
